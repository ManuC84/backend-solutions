        <p>We are often asked what makes a brilliant text message. There is no right answer to this as there is no such thing as a size that fits all, but there are SMS templates that have proven to be effective for businesses. All of them share the following elements: powerful call-to-action triggers; the sender’s ID, name and phone number; and, occasionally, a short link to the sender’s website.

In a recent post, Neil Pearl mentioned that simply slapping a few common call-to-action triggers in an email or SMS won’t cut it, because the perfect call to action has to resonate with the audience and create a sense of urgency (example: words like ‘today’ and ‘now’). With these things in mind, we have created a list of ready-to-use text message templates for small businesses.</p>
